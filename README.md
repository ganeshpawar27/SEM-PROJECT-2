6. Abstract:
Real-time object detection plays a vital role in AI applications, enabling machines to recognize and understand objects in images and videos. This project focuses on building a YOLOv8-based real-time object detection model that identifies and classifies thousands of object types using a PC camera. The model is trained on a custom dataset containing over 17,000 images, ensuring high accuracy and reliability across various objects.
To achieve precise detection, the model utilizes deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. Google Colab with GPU acceleration is used for training, improving efficiency and reducing processing time. The model processes live video feeds in real time, making detection fast and accurate.
This project is designed to be scalable and portable, allowing it to run on PCs, cloud platforms, and edge devices. It has applications in security (intruder detection), automation (self-checkout systems), healthcare (PPE compliance), and industry (defect detection). By enhancing object recognition speed and accuracy, this project contributes to the advancement of AI-powered vision systems and real-world automation.
